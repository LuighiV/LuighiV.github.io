Personal webpage site

This is the site I created to share the information about my personal trajectory and the projects I have developed.
I use Jekyll as the static site generator as well as liquid templates to render the information from data files.
In general, the information is stored in a Google Sheet and is downloaded to the `generated` folder, from which
it is used to fill the content in the different pages.

In addition to this I use a converter for a .bib file to json via Pandoc to parse the information about my publications.
